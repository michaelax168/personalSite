    <p>
      Hello! My name is Michael Gachich and I'm currently a freshman at the University of
      Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Currently,
      I'm undeclared, but I am looking to transfer into one of our CS or CS + X programs
      to further my passion for this exciting field. I'll be posting my side projects here
      as well as giving updates on what I'm currently up to. Cheers!
      </p>

        I'm starting a text-based game today! It will be a small world with
        a map set in a medieval village, and will be a sort of a mystery, and single player.
        I'm drawing inspiration from various MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games I played in my
        childhood. I don't necessarily know how fast it will go along, as I still have to focus
        on schoolwork, but expect to see more!

          Finishing up classes and preparing for final exams has proven to be a daunting task... However,
          I am making progress! I have committed my game to GitHub, and jumped right into writing it. That
          might not be the best idea, but I couldn't help it! I did run across some problems stemming from
          inexperience (throwing/catching exceptions, utilizing the SLEEP method, etc.) but nothing too bad
          so far. The best thing about side projects is definitely learning along the way, and it's great.
          </p>

            Today I am finishing up my final project for CS 125. My partner and I have worked really hard
            to bring this to fruition, and we are both excited to display it at the final project fair for
            the class. It's a quirky little Android application that saves a random quote, gives the user parts
            of speech and modifies the quote with fun words the user inputs; like MadLibs when we were little. Check
            it out <a class="s" href="https://github.com/arman-mahtabfar/MadLibs-App">here</a>!
