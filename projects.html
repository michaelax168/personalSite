      <h3><strong>Urdven</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Text-based mystery game... For some reason, I'm thinking of TES 3: Morrowind as I
        think about this game. It will be a single player game but very much akin to MUD(
        Multi-User Dunegons) of old. I'm challenging myself to make it take place in a small area (a village)
        but still have a lot of areas to explore and many clues to be connected. I'm looking forward to working
        on it!

        <p> As of 20/11/2018, I have uploaded what I've been working on to GitHub! It's not much, but check it out on the link below if you'd like.<br>

        <h3><strong>Quote-Libs!</strong></h3>
        <p>
          My first Android application, nearing completion. My partner and I have had the pleasure of working together
          over the course of two weeks to create this from scratch, and it was quite the learning experience! A random
          quote is chosen for the user, and they have to input parts of speech, which are then inserted into the quote
          to make for some funny outcomes. Hopefully we can get a text-to-speech API up and running before the deadline,
          but, if not, we're still satisfied. Link below!
